AddressBookPicker
=================

Testing out Apple AddressBook Frameworks

This project is to try out the address book Apple framework. 
It integrates AddressBook Framework and Address Book UI Framework. 
Once a button is tapped, it displays a picker loaded with contacts from the address book. 
When a selection is made, it displays the contact's name property and phoen property. 

I plan to use this framework in the next project, so becoming familiar with this framework was my goal of this project.
